## TOPIC

## SHORT DESCRIPTION  
 Lists the cmdlets that are designed for use with Windows PowerShell providers.  
  
## LONG DESCRIPTION  
 Windows PowerShell includes a set of cmdlets that are specifically designed to manage the items in the data stores that are exposed by Windows PowerShell providers. You can use these cmdlets in the same ways to manage all the different types of data that the providers make available to you. For more information about providers, type "get\-help about\_providers".  
  
 For example, you can use the Get\-ChildItem cmdlet to list the files in a file system directory, the keys under a registry key, or the items that are exposed by a provider that you write or download.
